A single page web application using ReactJS.This is a static website which includes 2 columns, main and nav. In the main column there are 3 blog posts. To display the whole blog we will have to click on to the title of the blog posts. In the nav section I have displayed the headlines using AJAX call.
Instructions on how to run the ReactJS application:
1) To create a react project we will have to execute the following command in the command prompt:
    npx create-react-app my-app
2) After that, we will have to delete all the existing files in the src/ folder of the new project
3) Finally, we should add all the above files in the src/ folder
4) Now, from my-app directory we will have to run the command "npm start" to view the application in the browser
